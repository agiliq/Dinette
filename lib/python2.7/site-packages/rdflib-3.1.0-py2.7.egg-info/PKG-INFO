Description: RDFLib is a Python library for working with RDF, a simple yet powerful language for representing information.
        
            The library contains parsers and serializers for RDF/XML, N3,
            NTriples, Turtle, TriX and RDFa . The library presents a Graph
            interface which can be backed by any one of a number of Store
            implementations, including, Memory, MySQL, Redland, SQLite,
            Sleepycat and SQLObject.
            
            If you have recently reported a bug marked as fixed, or have a craving for
            the very latest, you may want the development version instead:
